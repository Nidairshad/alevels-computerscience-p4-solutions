Hi , this font is very cool okay so this is nida and i am trying to explore git hub and learn how it works (2) repeating myself again here do we add description of respositires here or 
do we do code here asking myself question
whatever it is , to add more detail this repositry is for learning purpose for alevels student 
i found myself in trouble when i coded although i saw markscheme but  didnt UNDERSTAND
any solution so 
i thought why not help others(hehe nojoke here) and make people face less difficulty(difficulty in learning alevels cs its pretty though the actual game will start in maths and phys if you have) 
sorry 
started yapping here and thats it :)
